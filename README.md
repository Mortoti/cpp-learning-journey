# 🚀 Mortoti's C++ Projects

Welcome to my collection of C++ programs! This repository marks the beginning of my programming journey and serves as a testament to where it all started.

## 📖 About This Repository

When I first started learning programming, I knew nothing about version control or proper project organization. I wrote all these programs in a single file, commenting out one before starting the next. Today, I'm preserving this important chapter of my learning journey by organizing and sharing these programs.

After mastering C++ fundamentals, I transitioned to Python with the goal of becoming a backend developer specializing in Django.

## 💡 What's Inside

This repository contains various C++ programs I wrote while learning fundamental programming concepts:

- **Control Structures**: Loops and conditionals
- **Data Structures**: Arrays and 2D arrays
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files
- **Basic Algorithms**: Arithmetic operations and calculations
- **Problem Solving**: Real-world scenarios like ordering systems and parking management

Each program represents a different challenge or mini-project that helped solidify my understanding of programming basics.

## 📂 Project Structure

All programs have been separated into individual files for clarity and ease of navigation.

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `basic_arithmetic.cpp` | Demonstrates step-by-step arithmetic operations on a variable |
| `discount_calculator.cpp` | Calculates discounts based on bill amounts |
| `students_scores.cpp` | Manages names and scores for 5 students |
| `students_2darray.cpp` | Uses 2D arrays to store and display marks for 3 students across 4 subjects |
| `transport_ticket_calculator.cpp` | Computes ticket prices with age-based discounts |
| `garage_parking_system.cpp` | Simulates a parking garage with slot management and availability checks |
| `restaurant_order_system.cpp` | Complete ordering system with quantities, discounts, tax calculations, and receipt generation |
| `adult_quiz.cpp` | Interactive quiz program with scoring and replay functionality |
| `student_report_system.cpp` | Comprehensive student management: scores input, average calculation, grade assignment, and file storage |
| `file_handling_students.cpp` | Demonstrates file I/O by storing and retrieving student data |
| `multiplication_table.cpp` | Generates multiplication tables for user-specified numbers |
| `sum_average_two_numbers.cpp` | Simple calculator for sum and average of two numbers |
| `rectangle_area_perimeter.cpp` | Geometric calculator for rectangles |
| `user_file_data.cpp` | Basic file handling with user information storage |
| `guessing_game.cpp` | Interactive number guessing game with random generation and limited trials |
| `student_scores_optimized.cpp` | Enhanced version managing 8 subjects with grade calculations |
| `jollof_banku_order.cpp` | Food ordering system with item selection, discounts, tax, and receipt printing |

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Basic knowledge of command line operations

### Compilation and Execution

To compile and run any program:

```bash
# Compile
g++ -o program_name file_name.cpp

# Run
./program_name
```

**Example:**
```bash
g++ -o guessing_game guessing_game.cpp
./guessing_game
```

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow (if-else, switch, loops)
- Functions and modular programming
- Arrays and multi-dimensional arrays
- File input/output operations
- User input validation
- Basic algorithm design
- Problem decomposition

## 🌱 My Journey

This repository represents my foundation in programming. Starting with zero knowledge of version control, I wrote these programs as I learned, building up my skills one concept at a time. 

**Current Focus**: After mastering C++ fundamentals, I've moved on to Python and am working toward my goal of becoming a backend developer with Django expertise.

## 📝 Notes

- All programs were originally written in a single file with each new program commented out
- Each program has been tested and runs successfully
- Code style reflects beginner-level programming (and that's okay! 🎓)
- This collection is preserved as-is to show authentic learning progression
